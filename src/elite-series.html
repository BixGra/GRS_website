              The Gamers Assembly, the largest LAN event in France, has been a cornerstone of the gaming community
              since its inception. Since 2008, when Trackmania first became a staple of the event, Gamers Assembly
              has strived to showcase and celebrate the diversity within the Trackmania community.
              <br><br>
              Each year, thousands of gamers converge upon Poitiers to participate in this epic event, showcasing
              their skills and passion for gaming. Held annually in Poitiers over the Easter weekend, Gamers Assembly
              has become a beloved tradition for gamers worldwide, offering an unforgettable experience filled with
              excitement, competition, and camaraderie.

              Every year, the scale and attendance curve of the “Comic Con Baltics” event significantly rises.
              Delighted with the engagement of the popular culture community, the event team strives to offer more
              and more engaging experiences. After listening to visitors’ needs and interests, last year much
              attention was paid to gaming and technology themes. The team of gaming fanatics unleashed their
              ideas, hobbies, and energy and unveiled a new format – “Baltic Gaming Expo”.
              <br><br>
              Alongside many spaces tailored for gaming fans, “Baltics Gaming Expo” also introduces tournaments for
              the most popular games in the world. During the event, the best regional players compete in Counter
              Strike, League of Legends, Valorant and other tournaments.
              <br><br>
              This year the Trackmania section returns with double the slots as in 2023 and an even bigger ambition
              to establish itself as one of the premier events in the franchise's landscape. By combining the regional
              and international playerbases and audience, this event is the perfect proving grounds for up-and-coming
              talent, as well as seasoned veterans looking for new Trackmania LAN experiences.
              <br><br>
              See you on May 24-26, at LITEXPO, Vilnius.

              Lan ETS is a non-profit organization hosting the largest LAN party event in Canada every year with about
              1650+ BYOC seats, 1000+ competitors and 500+ visitors.
              <br><br>
              In 2022 and 2023, we were finally able to have in-person events once again. We celebrated our 20th
              anniversary by having our event where it all began, at l'École de téchnologie supérieure. 800+
              participants and 600+ visitors attended and celebrated to occasion with us, along with our partners.
              <br><br>
              With the 2 previous editions, we built back up our community and the demand is never ending as we are the
              only event of our type to be around in the East side of North America. With this, we aim to make a bigger
              and better Lan ETS by expanding our event and breaking the peak numbers we had back in 2020. That is why
              for our 22nd edition, happening in Summer 2024, we will have ours event at Palais des Congrès. Being able
              to be back in this venue will allow us to welcome more participants and bring back Lan ETS on a bigger
              scale.

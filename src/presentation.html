              The Global Racing Series is a circuit of events held on the racing
              game <a href="https://www.trackmania.com/">Trackmania</a>. This circuit gathers 25 events ranging from
              the beginner-friendly fun tournament to the top-end competition between the best players in the world.
              All along the year, the players earn points by participating in any <a href="events.html">event</a> of
              the circuit.
              <br><br>
              The season ends with the <a href="all-star.html">GRS All-Star</a> where the best players fight for a
              prestigious title. Stay tuned, the format of the event can change depending on the support given to
              the Global Racing Series.
              <br><br>
              Our vision of this project is based on three mains pillars: Transparency, Community and Quality. First of
              all, we want everyone this to understand how the project works and why we are doing it. Of course, we
              can't share everything, but we will share as much as possible. Since we are building a project with
              the community events for the community, we want to hear your feedbacks and will do our best to take them
              into account. As you will see it with the GRS All-Star format, we want to start with realistic ambitions
              and make sure we create qualitative projects. The goal is to create a healthy structure to build and grow
              on.
              <br><br>
              If you want more details on our budget and the ways to support us, you can head

              Trackmania is an arcade racing game developed
              by <a href="https://www.nadeo.com/" target="_blank">Nadeo</a> and published
              by <a href="//www.ubisoft.com/" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a> in 2020. This opus is the last of a
              successful series of games started in 2003. In this game, drivers race as fast as possible from the start
              to the finish line on custom tracks that anyone can build with the in-game editor.
              <br><br>
              The game is very easy to learn with only 4 keys (accelerate, brake, left and right) and no collision with
              your opponents, but requires a huge amount of training and skill to master all its specificities.
              <br><br>
              Trackmania suits every public and is very easy to understand for anyone: everyone starts at the
              same time and the first to cross the finish line is the winner.

              Nosebug is the legal entity managing the Global Racing Series. It's a French association created under
              "loi 1901". Initially a team created as a joke by a group of players in 2018, it became more than that
              and most of the first members are still here to this day. We have had the time to grow skills
              in video making, in design, in web development and in tournaments and events organization and management.
